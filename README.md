# pxe
The script was designed for Debian based distros. I have not written any for, or tried to write any for, other ditros yet.

Building a pxe server, thought of making a script that can make one by itself
The preseeds included do not have a username or password included (for security purposes)

The script was thrown together yesterday and I feel like it could bemore efficient.
